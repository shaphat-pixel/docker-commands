# docker-commands
This is a repo of important commands in Docker that I think I need to understand or be aware of.

# docker pull NAME_OF_IMAGE
The pull command fetches an image from the Docker registry and saves it to our system.

# docker run name_of_container
The run command is used to run a docker container

# docker ps
The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.

# docker ps -a
The -a variant shows us containers that have exited.

# docker run -it name_of_container sh
The "-it" variant allows us to write additional commands by giving us an interface. We can exit out of the interface by typing "exit"

# docker rm container_id
This command is used to delete a container in other to free up space.
